# QuLab: Maximum Loss Scenario Explorer

## Description

This Streamlit application, **QuLab: Maximum Loss Scenario Explorer**, is designed to help users understand and visualize maximum loss scenarios in a synthetic portfolio. By interactively adjusting constraints on key risk factors such as Interest Rates, Equity Indices, and Credit Spreads, users can explore how these factors influence potential portfolio losses.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive Risk Factor Adjustment:** Use sliders to define the range of changes for Interest Rates, Equity Indices, and Credit Spreads.
*   **Scenario Simulation:** Generate multiple scenarios based on the defined risk factor constraints.
*   **Portfolio Loss Calculation:** Calculate portfolio loss for each scenario using a simplified linear model based on factor sensitivities.
*   **Interactive Scatter Plot Visualization:** Visualize scenarios as a scatter plot, showing Portfolio Loss against a selected Risk Factor, with scenario probability indicated by color.
*   **Scenario Exploration:** Hover over data points in the scatter plot to view detailed information about each scenario, including risk factor changes, portfolio loss, and scenario probability.

**Learning Outcomes:**

*   Understand maximum loss scenarios and the impact of risk factors on portfolio performance.
*   Interpret interactive visualizations to gain insights from simulated data.
*   Learn about data preprocessing and scenario exploration techniques for risk assessment.
*   Experience a user-friendly interface for real-time data interaction and visualization.

This application is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the principles of maximum loss scenario exploration in a simplified setting.

## Installation

To run this Streamlit application, you need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or higher.

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```

    If you have downloaded the script directly, navigate to the directory containing the script in your terminal.

2.  **Install required Python packages:**

    Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
    ```

    This command will install:
    *   `streamlit`:  For creating the web application.
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `numpy`: For numerical computations.
    *   `plotly`: For interactive plotting.

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`your_script_name.py`) in your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
    ```

    Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script file.

2.  **Access the application in your browser:**

    Streamlit will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can access it by navigating to the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Interact with the application:**

    *   **Sidebar:** The sidebar on the left displays the application title and the QuantUniversity logo.
    *   **Risk Factor Constraints:** Use the sliders in the "Define Risk Factor Constraints" section to set the minimum and maximum changes for each risk factor:
        *   **Interest Rate Change (%)**
        *   **Equity Index Change (%)**
        *   **Credit Spread Change (bps)**
        Adjust the sliders to define the range of market scenarios you want to explore.
    *   **Scatter Plot Visualization:** The "Interactive Scenario Visualization" section displays a scatter plot:
        *   **X-axis:** Select a Risk Factor from the dropdown menu to plot on the X-axis.
        *   **Y-axis:**  The Y-axis always represents "Portfolio Loss".
        *   **Color:** The color of each point represents the "Scenario Probability", with more intense colors indicating higher probability.
        *   **Hover:** Hover over data points to see a tooltip with detailed information about the scenario, including changes in all risk factors, portfolio loss, and scenario probability.
    *   **Explore Scenarios:** Analyze the scatter plot to identify potential maximum loss scenarios and understand how different risk factor changes impact the portfolio.
    *   **Key Insights and Further Exploration:** Read the "Key Insights and Further Exploration" section for guidance on interpreting the results and suggestions for further analysis.
